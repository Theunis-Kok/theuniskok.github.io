Welcome to my virtual CV's GitHub repository.

My thought process behind this project was to use mainstream technologies and languages that are being used in the industry to show of my skills. I wanted to create something that is pleasing to the eye but is also easy to read and make the reader understand my story better.

My initial commit is almost the whole finished project. As I created this virtual CV in almost a day. I still have some minor changes that I want to apply but will shorty commit and push those changes.
